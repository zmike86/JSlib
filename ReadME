All the files in the JSlib folder I added is proposed to provide small and lightweight common module to our project.
At present, all the varibles in the JS files attached to the window object ( which I think is not a good idea and 
will be changed to a scoped object later, eg: sogo.lib.Class or after I commit my dynamic loader for js files, it would a AMD fitted
JS library). It is just the beginning.
